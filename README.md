###Chitter Challenge###

The purpose of the Chitter Challenge is to test the knowledge of and skills in BDD, TDD, OOP, web-integration and database interaction gained over the previous few weeks to build a (basic) working clone of a famous Social Networking website. It utilises Ruby for the engine, with testing using Capybara, Cucumber and RSpec, with the web interface generated using Sinatra. Underlying all this is a PostgreSQL database. The challenge is outlined in the [Instructions](./Instructions.md) and is to be completed over the weekend, and the progress submitted by 09:00 BST on Monday 13th April.
